"""Data Analysis vertical workflows.

This package provides workflow definitions for common data analysis tasks:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Statistical analysis
- Machine Learning pipeline

Uses YAML-first architecture with Python escape hatches for complex conditions
and transforms that cannot be expressed in YAML.

Example:
    provider = DataAnalysisWorkflowProvider()

    # Compile and execute (recommended - uses UnifiedWorkflowCompiler with caching)
    result = await provider.run_compiled_workflow("eda_pipeline", {"data_path": "data.csv"})

    # Stream execution with real-time progress
    async for node_id, state in provider.stream_compiled_workflow("eda_pipeline", context):
        print(f"Completed: {node_id}")

Available workflows (all YAML-defined):
- eda_pipeline: Full EDA with parallel statistics and visualizations
- eda_quick: Lightweight EDA for quick analysis
- data_cleaning: Systematic cleaning with validation loop
- data_cleaning_quick: Automated cleaning without human review
- statistical_analysis: Hypothesis testing and statistical modeling
- ml_pipeline: End-to-end ML pipeline with hyperparameter tuning
- ml_quick: Quick baseline model training
